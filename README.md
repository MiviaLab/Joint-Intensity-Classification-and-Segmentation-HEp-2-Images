# Joint Intensity Classification and Specimen Segmentation on HEp-2 Images: a Deep Learning Approach
Repository of the model, loss, training and testing scripts of the related work submitted to ICPR 2022.

This is the implementation of a joint approach on two important tasks of HEp-2 image analysis. The two tasks are the intensity classification and specimen segmentation, which are fundamental and required tasks for the development of an end-to-end system.

In the repository are present the training and testing (cross_validation.py), the loss (loss.py) and the model used (models.py)
